kicker-stats-sorter
===================

This is a simple bookmarklet to sort kicker.de player rankings by score/price-ratio. It is very helpful to find good candidates in the [kicker.de management game](http://www.kicker.de/games/startseite/gamesstartseite.html).

On the gh-pages http://hkorte.github.io/kicker-stats-sorter/ you find the button to drag to your bookmarks.

Goto http://manager.kicker.de/interactive/bundesliga/spielerliste/ and click the bookmarklet to get an additional column called "Ratio". This is simply the ratio between score and price, i.e. the score per price in millions.

Please let me know, if you have any problems using it.
